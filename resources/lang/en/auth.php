	'storyDes' => 'Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited Singapore in 2006, wearing a strapless gown and a diamond crown on her head. Her face is flawless and charming. Elizabeth came to Queenstown to communicate with the local people face to face. Many local women faced the Queen’s demeanor and believed that Queen Elizabeth was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was 80 years old and her skin was still smooth, supple, healthy and delicate. Kelly You, the founder of the Xizhiyan brand, made up his mind at that time, hoping to one day create a facial skin care product for women all over the world, so that women can have healthy skin. This has planted a seed that needs to be germinated for the founding of MYQUEEN.

                                
                                With her dedication to "having healthy skin" and her travels overseas, and even visited the UK many times, Kelly You has been looking for answers to how to have healthy skin. As a result, any skin care products are not the source of healthy skin. According to well-known dermatology According to the doctor, one of the things to get healthy skin is persistence day after day. Even for the Queen of England, the essence of skin care is sunscreen, cleansing and bedtime care.
                                
                                Second is sun protection. Sun protection is indispensable in skin care procedures in any country. In the documentary produced by the British BBC, the truth is revealed. The biggest cause of wrinkles on the skin is sun exposure, which is the cause of all wrinkles. Among them, sun exposure accounts for 75%, and all effective anti-aging stunts are sun protection. Even in Britain, which is rainy all year round, the Queen of England also pays great attention to sun protection, often wearing hats and sunglasses outdoors.
                                
                                Furthermore, skin conditioning needs to be solved from the root cause. No organism can do without water. Water is the most important element of life metabolism. Water can come from daily skin care and food. Moisturizing and post-sun repair are the "source of conditioning".
                                
                                As time passed, the time came to April 2019. In an occasional social interaction, Kelly You met Dr. Eric Lim, an expert in skin care formulations, and learned that he is a well-known person in the skin care industry with an independent skin laboratory and numerous skins behind him. With the support of academic experts, Kelly You believes that the time has come to create a healthy skin brand, and immediately the MYQUEEN brand and Xizhiyan Lab were officially registered in Singapore in May 2019.
                                    Determined to make the myth of agelessness of Queen Elizabeth of England happen to women all over the world, this is the common vision of Kelly You and MYQUEEN brand.',
